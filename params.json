  "body": "### Tomato is here!  \r\nTomato is the ORM framework for the modern development world. \r\nWhen using Tomato, you will never generate nor write entity classes.  You will not write repository classes.  You will not write service classes.  You will not need to configure a persistence context.  You will not need to work with EntityManager instances.  \r\nAnd in return, Tomato gives you more performance and more flexibility in less lines of code.  Tomato is also completely thread safe without any modifications - simply ensure each thread uses its own entity instance.  \r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n1. Download the Tomato source.  \r\n2. Unpack it into a new Java Project in whatever IDE you desire.\r\n3. Modify the EntityDataSource class so that it initializes a properly configured DataSource instance for the database you desire Tomato to connect to.\r\n4. Build the project into a jar file.  \r\n5. Include the jar in the project of your choice.\r\n6. Check out the code in the EntityTest.java class.  This includes samples for how to use all of Tomatos functionality.\r\n\r\n## How easy is it, really?\r\nThe following is the code needed to retrieve all records in any table... \r\nEntity e = Entity.createEntityOrView(\"Schema.tableName\"); \r\ne.setFilter(\"1=1\"); \r\ne.load(); \r\n\r\nWant to load and save a hierarchy? Like say, employees and their addresses? The following will load all employee records with nested addresses under each. Entity e = Entity.createEntityOrView(\"schema.employee\"); e.setFilter(\"1=1\"); ChildData cd = new ChildData(\"schema.address\", \"address_id\", false, false); e.getChildList().add(cd); e.load();\r\n\r\n### If you are doing web development\r\nYou can also download the companion project Basil.   Basil provides dynamic forms and tables for any Tomato entity instance.  Basil is written in Angular 1.5 and provides for simply injection of custom HTML where ever needed in a dynamic form or table.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTomato was created by Rodney P. Barbati.  \r\nRodney felt that since we have been reading and writing data from tables for decades, it should be easier.  Now it is. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me with questions, feature requests or just to let me know how Tomato is working for you!  \r\nrodney.barbati@gmail.com.",
